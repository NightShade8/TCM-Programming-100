## 🐍 Best Practices for Variable Naming in Python

### ✅ Use `snake_case` for Variable Names
Snake case ensures:
- All letters are in lowercase.
- Words are separated by underscores (`_`).

#### Example:
```python
total_amount = 100  # Stores the total amount
user_name = "JohnDoe"  # Stores the user's name
is_valid = True  # Indicates if something is valid
```

### 🤔 Why Snake Case?
- **🔍 Readability**: Clearly separates words, making variable names easier to read.
- **🔄 Consistency**: Ensures uniformity across your project, aiding maintainability.
- **📜 PEP 8 Compliance**: Aligns with Python's official style guide, fostering community standards.

### 📝 Additional Best Practices for Variable Naming

#### 1️⃣ Use Meaningful Names
- Choose descriptive names that clarify the variable's purpose.
- Avoid single-letter names unless widely accepted (e.g., `i` for loop counters).

##### Examples:
```python
# Good
total_sales = 500  # Represents total sales amount
number_of_items = 10  # Represents the count of items

# Bad
x = 500  # Unclear purpose
n = 10  # Unclear purpose
```

#### 2️⃣ Avoid Reserved Keywords
- Do not use Python reserved words (e.g., `class`, `def`, `if`) as variable names.

##### Example:
```python
# Bad
class = "example"  # ❌ SyntaxError: 'class' is a reserved keyword
```

#### 3️⃣ Use `ALL_UPPERCASE` for Constants
- For values that do not change, use uppercase letters with underscores.

##### Example:
```python
MAX_SIZE = 100  # Maximum allowed size
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 30  # Default timeout value
```

#### 4️⃣ Prefix Private Variables with `_`
- Use a leading underscore (`_`) to indicate variables intended for internal use.

##### Example:
```python
_cache = {}  # Internal cache dictionary
_internal_variable = 42  # Internal variable
```

#### 5️⃣ Avoid Mixing Naming Styles
- Stick to one convention (`snake_case`) for variables in Python. Avoid mixing with `camelCase`.

##### Examples:
```python
# Bad
userName = "John"  # ❌ camelCase

# Good
user_name = "John"  # ✅ snake_case
```
