# üßÆ Building a Calculator

This script demonstrates how to build a simple calculator in Python. Below is the code with explanations for each line:

```python
# Prompt the user to input the first number and convert it to a float
x = float(input("Give me a number: "))

# Prompt the user to input an operator (e.g., +, -, *, /, **, ^)
o = input("Give me an operator: ")

# Prompt the user to input the second number and convert it to a float
y = float(input("Give me yet another number: "))

# Check the operator and perform the corresponding calculation
if o == "+":  # If the operator is addition
    print(x + y)  # Print the sum of x and y
elif o == "-":  # If the operator is subtraction
    print(x - y)  # Print the difference of x and y
elif o == "/":  # If the operator is division
    print(x / y)  # Print the quotient of x and y
elif o == "*":  # If the operator is multiplication
    print(x * y)  # Print the product of x and y
elif o == "**" or o == "^":  # If the operator is exponentiation
    print(x ** y)  # Print x raised to the power of y
else:  # If the operator is not recognized
    print("Unknown operator.")  # Print an error message
```

### üìù Explanation
1. **Input Handling**: The `input()` function is used to get user input, and `float()` ensures the numbers are treated as decimals.
2. **Operator Check**: The `if-elif-else` structure checks the operator and performs the corresponding operation.
3. **Error Handling**: If the operator is not recognized, the program outputs "Unknown operator."

### üöÄ Try It Yourself!
Copy the code into a Python environment and test it with different inputs to see how it works.
