In Python, boolean expressions are expressions that evaluate to either True or False. They are typically used in conditional statements and logical operations to make decisions based on the truth or falsity of certain conditions. Relational operators are used to compare values and create boolean expressions. Here's an explanation of boolean expressions and relational operators in Python:

### 🔗 Relational Operators and Boolean Expressions in Python

#### 📏 Relational Operators:
Python provides several relational operators to compare values. These operators are essential for creating conditions in your code:

- **Equality (`==`)**: Checks if two values are equal.  
- **Inequality (`!=`)**: Checks if two values are not equal.  
- **Greater than (`>`)**: Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.  
- **Less than (`<`)**: Checks if the left value is less than the right value.  
- **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**: Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.  
- **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**: Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.  

#### 🧠 Boolean Expressions:
Boolean expressions evaluate to either `True` or `False`. They are formed by combining relational expressions with logical operators:

- **Logical AND (`and`)**: Returns `True` if both operands are `True`.  
- **Logical OR (`or`)**: Returns `True` if at least one operand is `True`.  
- **Logical NOT (`not`)**: Negates the value of the operand.  

#### 📝 Examples:
```python
x = 5
y = 10

# Relational operators
print(x == y)   # Output: False
print(x < y)    # Output: True

# Boolean expressions
print(x < y and y > 0)    # Output: True
print(x < y or y < 0)     # Output: True
print(not (x == y))       # Output: True
```

In the example above:
- Relational operators like `==` and `<` compare the values of `x` and `y`.
- Logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not` combine these comparisons to evaluate the overall truth value.

#### 🔍 Additional Boolean Examples:
```python
# Boolean expressions (True or False)
print("Boolean expressions:")

bool1 = True
bool2 = 3 * 3 == 9
bool3 = False
bool4 = 3 * 3 != 9

print(bool1, bool2, bool3, bool4)  # Output: True True False True
print(type(bool1))  # Output: <class 'bool'>

bool5 = "True"
print(type(bool5))  # Output: <class 'str'>

# Relational and Boolean operators
greater_than = 7 > 5
less_than = 5 < 7
greater_than_equal_to = 7 >= 7
less_than_equal_to = 7 <= 7

test_and = True and True  # True
test_and2 = True and False  # False
test_or = True or True  # True
test_or2 = True or False  # True

test_not = not True  # False
```

#### 🚀 Why Use Boolean Expressions and Relational Operators?
Boolean expressions and relational operators are fundamental in controlling the flow of your program. They are extensively used in:
- **`if` statements**: To execute code based on conditions.  
- **`while` loops**: To repeat code while a condition is `True`.  
- **Other control structures**: To determine the execution path of your code.
