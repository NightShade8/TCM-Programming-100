## 🔢 Boolean Expressions & Relational Operators

This section introduces how Python evaluates conditions using boolean logic. It covers:

- `True` and `False` values
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- Relational operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- Combining expressions for complex conditions

📌 **Use Case:** Understand how to write expressions that control program flow.

## 🔀 Conditional Statements

Learn how to control program execution using decision-making structures.

- `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Nested conditionals
- Logical branching using conditions
- Common pitfalls (e.g., indentation, comparison vs assignment)

📌 **Use Case:** Execute different code blocks based on dynamic conditions.

---

## 🔁 Loops

Explore how to repeat actions with precision using Python loops.

- `while` loops and their control flow
- `for` loops with `range()`
- Loop control: `break`, `continue`, `pass`
- Looping through strings, lists, and other iterables

📌 **Use Case:** Perform tasks repeatedly until a condition is met or data is exhausted.

## 🧮 Building a Basic Calculator

Hands-on example of combining earlier concepts to build an interactive calculator.

- Gathering user input
- Performing arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
- Using conditionals to handle different operations
- Optional enhancements (looping menu, input validation)

📌 **Use Case:** Apply core concepts to build a simple real-world project.
