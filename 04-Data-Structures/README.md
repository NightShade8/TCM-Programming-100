# üìö Data Structures Overview

Welcome to the **Data Structures** README! This document provides a quick reference for understanding and working with essential Python data structures. Each section includes a brief summary to help you locate the information you need.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Lists
**Summary**:  
Lists are ordered, mutable collections that can store a variety of data types. They are ideal for managing sequences of items where modifications like adding, removing, or updating elements are required.

**Key Features**:  
- Ordered and indexed.
- Mutable (can be changed).
- Supports duplicate elements.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Tuples
**Summary**:  
Tuples are immutable, ordered collections. They are useful for storing data that should not be modified after creation, such as coordinates or configuration values.

**Key Features**:  
- Ordered and indexed.
- Immutable (cannot be changed).
- Supports duplicate elements.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dictionaries
**Summary**:  
Dictionaries are unordered, mutable collections of key-value pairs. They are perfect for scenarios where you need to associate unique keys with specific values, such as a phone book or a configuration map.

**Key Features**:  
- Key-value pair structure.
- Keys must be unique and immutable.
- Values can be of any data type.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Strings Revisited
**Summary**:  
Strings are immutable sequences of characters. This section revisits advanced string manipulation techniques, including slicing, formatting, and common string methods.

**Key Features**:  
- Immutable (cannot be changed).
- Supports slicing and indexing.
- Rich set of built-in methods for manipulation.
